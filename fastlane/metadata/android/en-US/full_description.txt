A copylefted libre app to monitor and export the network traffic of your device. \
The app simulates a VPN to achieve non-root capture but, contrary to a VPN processes the traffic locally on the device.

<b>Features:</b>

* Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps.
* Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP request, HTTP URL, and the remote IP address.
* Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies.
* Dump traffic into a PCAP file, download it from a web browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real-time analysis (e.g. Wireshark).
* Use the app in combination with mitmproxy to decrypt HTTPS/TLS traffic (technical knowledge required).
* On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running.
* Not only Open Source, but also copyleft. Use, inspect, change, and share — with all.
